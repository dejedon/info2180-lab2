            <p> My favourite movie series is Fast and the Furious. I have watched every single 
                one of the movies. </p>
            <p> I truly enjoyed all the driving scenes and outstanding acting from 
                Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker. </p>

            <p> A network is a group of two or more computers or other electronic devices that 
                are interconnected for the purpose of exchanging data and sharing resources. </p>
            <p> A network engineer is a technology professional who has the necessary skills to 
                plan, implement and oversee the computer networks that support in-house voice, 
                data, video and wireless network services. </p>
